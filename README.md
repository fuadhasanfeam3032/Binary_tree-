# Binary_tree-
This program implements a Binary Tree using a node-based dynamic memory structure in C. Each tree node stores a character value along with pointers to its left child, right child, and parent node. The code supports essential binary tree operations such as counting total nodes, counting leaf nodes, and determining the number of internal nodes. Recursive traversal techniques including Preorder, Inorder, and Postorder traversals are implemented to display the tree structure systematically. Additionally, the program calculates the height (level) of the binary tree and counts the number of vowel characters stored in the nodes. Overall, this implementation demonstrates effective use of recursion and pointers to manipulate and analyze a non-linear data structure.
